## Project: Next Word Prediction Using Deep Learning

### Install

This project requires **Python** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/install.html).

You can install all the requirements by running the following command in your terminal:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. 

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```
$ ipython notebook main.ipynb
```  
or
```
$ jupyter notebook main.ipynb
```
or open with Juoyter Lab
```
$ jupyter lab
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.
